# Spam Classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Objective
Developed a spam classification system to detect and filter out spam messages across various platforms (emails, texts, comments).

## Key Technologies
- Utilized **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to process and classify textual data.
- Applied machine learning algorithms such as **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for classification tasks.
- Implemented **TF-IDF** and **Bag of Words (BoW)** for feature extraction.

## Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and preprocessed text data by removing noise, such as stop words, special characters, and URLs.
- Performed **tokenization**, **stemming**, and **lemmatization** to standardize text.

## Model Development
- Built and trained classification models using **scikit-learn**.
- Achieved high classification accuracy by optimizing model parameters using **grid search** and **cross-validation**.

## Evaluation and Metrics
- Evaluated model performance using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** metrics.
- Analyzed the **confusion matrix** to assess the model's precision in detecting spam.

## Deployment
- Developed a user-friendly **web application** using **Flask/FastAPI** to deploy the model.
- Enabled users to input messages for real-time spam detection.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**, **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **nltk**, **spaCy**, **Flask/FastAPI**.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **X%** (mention the accuracy if relevant) in classifying spam and non-spam messages.
- Reduced false positives/negatives, improving spam detection performance.
